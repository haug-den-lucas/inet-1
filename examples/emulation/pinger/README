The CAP_NET_RAW privilege requires for using ExtEthernetSocket in INET.

The next commands adds this privilege to opp_run, so the all simulation
has the CAP_NET_RAW privilege, all simulations run with this privilege!!!
This is dangerous because it enables a thousand other things for all
running simulations, it becomes a big security hole.

$> sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg

For remove extra privileges after run the simulation, use next commands:

$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg
